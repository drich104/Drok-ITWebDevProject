        <td>The evolution of the web dates to the 1980s, 1989 to be exact. It began as part of a project called ENQUIRE which was developed by a British scientist name Tim Berners-Lee for the European Organization for Nuclear Research. (Author, 2014). He laid out the first initial concepts of HTML that would be used as the programing language of web URLs and HTTP protocols. Soon after the World Wide Web was born, and computer users would now be able to search the internet. AOL became one of the first email and instant messaging services that allow individuals to communicate with each other through the power of the internet. 1991 saw the first website using the protocols suggested by Lee when the first web server came online, that number ballooned to over 10,000 by 1994. That same year the International WWW Conference Committee or IW3C2 was formed to promote Web research and development. Also, in 1994 the domain name Yahoo is registered and went on to becoming one of the largest search engines in the world. The nineties proved to be very pivotal years for the web. 1994 saw the birth of Netscape Navigator and then in 1995 Microsoftâ€™s Internet Explorer was launched. 
          The nineties also ushered in the first social network and online auction site known as EBAY and internet user grew to over forty-four million. Moving into the 21st century, the web became the most essential tool in communicating and research. (Cardona, 2019). Search engines like Google and Yahoo help to promote the web even further as they produced algorithms and protocols that allow users to use keywords to conduct searches for anything topic or questions they could think up. The web also made an impact in the telecommunication world as it helped to create an environment for users to have access to the web using smart phones. 
          Today, there is an estimate 3 billion internet users, that is an estimated 37% of the population. The internet has grown to be the main source of information and communication through social media, instant messaging, online news sources and internet archive sites. Safe to say the over the last thirty plus years the growth of the web far exceeds the vision and expectations of its creators. As we move towards the age of Artificial Intelligence or AI, one can only imagine the boundless journey the WEB will take us.
